In order to run reports the DR must be set up to send the staffing reports to the NTST list, which forwards to a mailbox that I can access.

These are the settings that are configurable for each DR, and I will need to set up a new DR:

| name | what | example |
| :--- | :--  | :-- |
| DR Number | DRnnn-mm | DR225-22 |
| DTT User | User ID to used to access DTT | DR225-22Log-Tra9@redcross.org |
| Send Email | Email account to send email as | DR255-22Log-Tra2@redcross.org |
| Target List | Email address to send reports to | DR255-22Log-Tra1@redcross.org |
| Reply Email | (optional) email to list as 'reply' address | first.last@redcross.org |
| Report times | which reports to run and when to run them | Group Vehicle, Avis, Car, No-Car  run at 1400 Mountain time |
